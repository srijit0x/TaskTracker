This repository contains a Node.js server developed with TypeScript and the Express framework, designed to manage tasks through a RESTful API. It supports operations for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting tasks. The server is equipped with middleware integration for authentication, ensuring secure access to the API, comprehensive error handling for reliability and debugging, and CORS support to enable resource sharing across different domains. This setup is ideal for developers looking to interact with a task management system via a robust and secure API.
